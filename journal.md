# Title
Measurements of biomass burning emissions over Europe

# Introduction
Joe Bloggs et al (2004) already did some measurements, but haven't completed science yet. Hence our new measurements giving new insight and pushing the boundaries of science

Haywood et al 1999 were the pioneers of this type of measurement.

# Simulation
blah blah blah

#Methodology
We used an AMS to measure particle mass and chemical composition.
The AMS is described in Allen et al 2004

#Results
The simulation was able to reproduce the observed particle growth, so it's due to coagulation rather than condensation.

# Conclusions
We found out some stuff but give us more money to find out more stuff
